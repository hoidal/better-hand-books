When you donate to us, the books are added to our online platform’s inventory where schools, prisons, community programs and the people who need them most can access and request what they really want and need for free. We accept textbooks, children’s books, professional books, and novels in any condition.' ,

If this initial run proves successful, we will form a nonprofit and expand our outreach as far as possible. Thank you in advance for your support!',
